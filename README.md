<b>SLIDE 1</b>
<br>
Project 3 is a group based project – you must work with at least 2 other people.  
In the workplace, you will often have to work with others – lets get some practice.
For this project, you will be selecting your own datasets – one will not be provided for you. 
A list of websites to gather datasets will be given to you!
You will prepare a presentation for the class for this project.


<b>SLIDE 2</b>
<br>
For the remainder of class:
Find groupmates to work with.
Agree on a dataset with your group.  This dataset should relate to your current or future career.
Write a one paragraph proposal on this dataset – why is this dataset relevant to your current career.  How will it help you in your future current or future career?
Upload this proposal to your github account.

The project is open-ended – meaning, you can take any approach in Python that you’d like.
More often than not, as a data analytics professional, it will be up to you to decide what information is important, or what hidden discoveries are within your data.
Think outside the box and don’t be afraid to explore – there is no ‘one’ right answer or analysis. Have fun with it.  
Use google and other resources for assistance. Feel free to use any outside libraries that we haven’t spoken about – the choice is completely up to your group.
Presentations should last no more than 10 mins.
Presentations should be clear and concise. 
You may use PowerPoint or any other resources you’d like in your presentation.
